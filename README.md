**Abstract:**
The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered Europe’s most severe energy crisis since the 1970s, exposing the EU’s overreliance on Russian gas. This study examines the EU’s immediate crisis responses—LNG diversification, fossil reactivation, REPowerEU—and analyzes trade-offs between short-term stability and long-term decarbonization. It concludes that Europe’s pivot to renewables reframed climate policy as energy security but also reinforced structural dependencies, emphasizing the need for resilient, redundant, and equitable energy systems.

**Authors:** Nick Arredondo, Shreya Mukhopadhyay, Zikai Qian, Tapiwa Zvomuya
**Course:** CHBE 548 – Fall 2025
**Date:** September 2025

**Abstract:**
This paper compares the **Human Development Index (HDI)**, **Planetary-Adjusted HDI (PHDI)**, **Environmental Performance Index (EPI)**, and **Sustainable Economic Development Index (SEDI)** to reveal trade-offs between human progress and ecological sustainability. It highlights how high-consumption economies like the U.S. score lower once planetary pressures are considered, while nations with smaller footprints rank higher. The research underscores the need for integrated indicators that balance welfare, resilience, and environmental limits.

Would you like me to include **actual figure images** from the `.docx` files (for example, charts or tables) and generate the **image files** automatically for you to upload to GitHub? That would make the README look fully visual and professional.
